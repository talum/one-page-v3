If anyone tells you that interviewing for a new job as a software engineer
is easy and fun, they're lying.

A few years ago, as a brand-new apprentice developer, I was doing an AMA session on campus with current students
of the bootcamp I had attended when a student asked me about the
job search. I said, "It sucks." They laughed, betraying the horror on their
faces at the blunt confirmation of their worst fears. Some people in the back might have cried.

Afterward, my manager advised me to maybe not say that. But it was true then, and it's
definitely true now.

Tech interviewing is overall an unpleasant process that makes you question even after many years of professional
experience your validity as a software engineer as well as your own self-worth and intelligence.

I've been programming professionally for four years. I code; therefore, I am a
developer. I have built features from end-to-end. I have designed systems,
completed massive migrations in a legacy codebase, and also dipped my toes
into the world of ops. I have done lots of complex things and done them well. But
never have I doubted my abilities more than when I was interviewing.

But it's okay. Like, you'll get through it, survive. You'll bomb a couple interviews,
make some good impressions. You'll learn a lot about yourself in the process.
You might learn some new stuff about coding. You'll meet some weirdos as
well as some really awesome people, and at the end, you'll probably make
more money in the process. So overall, I suppose it's worth the suffering.

If you are looking for tips on how to survive interviewing mixed in with
some fun stories, you've come to the right place! Because I am starting a
job in about a month and I have got the hot goss.

# Make a Plan and Prep
If you're like me, then you like to plan things. I'm a planner. It is just
in my nature. To that effect, I started plotting an interview strategy a
year ago and came up with a rough timeline of when I wanted to have a new
job. My timeline wasn't exact, which stressed me out, but I quickly learned
to get over it because when you're interviewing there are also factors outside of your control (budget cuts, other candidates, useless interview questions, etc.).

Especially when you are starting to interview after a few years on the job, I think
it's really useful to come up with a general plan of attack. Interviewing
is, unfortunately, an entirely different skill set. You need to remember to
talk out loud and communicate your thought process. You need to know obscure
details about frameworks and be able to articulate them. You need to be able
to stomach stress and not throw up during onsites. It's a lot, and you need
to practice.

Working backward from my target new job start date, I estimated how long
it would take me to study and network and interview. For the most part, each
company's process took one month from start to end since there was about a
week between each phase of the process and most had three or four steps:

1) Recruiter screen in response to referral or application
2) Technical phone/video screens with software engineer or manager
3) Onsite interview

Knowing that I would probably bomb a couple interviews in the beginning, I
set aside time for simultaneous studying and interviews with companies that
I didn't really care about. And then, since I wanted to take a crack at some
of the bigger tech companies, I knew I needed a lot of time to actually
learn algorithms. (For what it's worth, my experience with companies who ask
about algorithms and data structures has been mixed. Many want to know if
you understand time and space complexity. Fewer are interested in whether
you know how to implement and use a heap.)

This left me with this rough timeline:

**Month 1:** Identify companies that seem cool and interesting. Start chatting
up friends and ask them what they're working on and if they know anyone else
who is working on cool stuff. Update resume and LinkedIn with latest job experience.

**Month 2:** Start responding to random recruiter requests that you don't really care about. Do the tech screens. Begin studying in earnest.

**Month 3:** Do a couple onsite practices. Get some referrals for companies and
apply for real.

**Month 4:** Do the real deals, phone screens, onsites, the whole thing.

**Month 5:** Accept offer and revel in glory.

###*Tools to Help You Organize*
I used a Trello board to help me keep track of the statues of each of my
opportunities. It was a pretty low-lift solution. I didn't do anything crazy
with reminders or statuses or anything, just a couple swimlanes.

I also kept notes on each opportunity in my actual email inbox. Whenever a
recruiter would reach out to me, I'd just keep the notes in a draft in the
same thread. Previously I've used note-taking software, but I found that it
was much easier to have all the information about an opportunity in one
place.

# Networking and Applying
So, generally, I am not a big fan of networking in the traditional sense,
but I am pretty good at connecting with people and maintaining friendships.
I go to the occasional Meetup, but I have been far more successful just
catching up with old colleagues and friends and seeing what they're working
on. If you are an introvert like me, maybe the same will work for you.

As far as applying to companies, from my own experience and based on the
advice I've received from coaches, it is practically useless to apply
blindly online. Occasionally I do it just to see what'll happen, but I'm
never counting on a response from those. For any place I actually want to
work at, I get a referral.

# Studying
Just from this round of interviewing, I found that studying was actually a
good idea. In the past when I'd interviewed, my primary focus was building
side projects to talk about. This time around, with tools like CoderPad and
CodeSandbox or whatever else is out there, it seems like a lot of companies
actually want to do some real code challenges (some problem-solving,
algorithm-y questions and some pair programming in a codebase challenges) with you in real time.

So with that in mind, and knowing that I wanted to interview at a large tech
company, I did a lot of studying.

First, I took a couple classes online about algorithms.

1) The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures by Steven
Grider https://www.udemy.com/share/101WU0AkIbeFdWTXQ=/
2) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass with Colt Steele
https://www.udemy.com/share/101XY2AkIbeFdWTXQ=/

I read a couple books, well, parts of some books.
1) Cracking the Coding Interview
2) The Algorithm Design Manual

I practiced on Leetcode every day.
