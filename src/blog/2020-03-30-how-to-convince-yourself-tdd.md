There comes a time in every developer's career when they must ask themselves
if they want to write a test before they write the actual code.

1. Mess up a few times. Feel the pain.
2. Read a bunch of books and intellectually understand why tests are good.
3. Work for a couple years in an ever-changing codebase, realize that you're making a lot of changes and
   praying. Hope does not inspire a lot of confidence in software
   development.
4. Learn about design patterns and object orientation. Realize that there is
   actually a better way and that you too can achieve it with tests.
5. Just add a test file and get over the hump. Sometimes the biggest barrier
   to entry is just getting a single test set up. So create a file and write
   the simplest test possible. Then expand.
6. If you aren't sure of the interface you want just yet, try writing
   descriptive tests first. That is, write the code you want, then write the
   test. Getting into the habit of writing a test is better than writing no
   test at all. You might miss a couple cases, but you do need a starting
   point.
7. Then once you're confident, begin refactoring and see what pleasure the
   ability to change code confidently brings.
8. Start writing the tests first. Then refactor to your heart's content.
9. Spread the word. TDD is super fun, especially when combined with
   ping-pong pairing. You can write garbage code at first just to make stuff
   pass, and keep iterating until you are happy.
