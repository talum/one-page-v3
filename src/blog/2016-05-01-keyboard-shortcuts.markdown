When I was first starting to learn how to code, I thought that I should dedicate all of my time to learning how to construct efficient methods, mastering syntax, and figuring out how to domain model. I powered through a ton of labs trying to make tests pass without spending time thinking about my workflow outside of solving problems.

Big mistake. Once you're a programmer in the real world, becoming more efficient as maneuvering around a computer is essential because it'll help you write code way faster, which increases your productivity and ultimately your impact. I never thought I'd say that. To me, it was always one of those things that productivity gurus overemphasize, but I suppose they are right in the end.

Enter [shortcutfoo.com]("https://www.shortcutfoo.com/"). For $8 a month, it'll change your life. I've been practicing my keyboard shortcuts every few days, and I've become a lot better at writing code faster. More specifically, I've been doing the Dojos for Sublime, Github, Gmail, and the command line, but I'm hoping to pick up vim soon so I can spend *all* my time in the matrix. 

At the very least, learning keyboard shortcuts will make you *seem* like you know what you're doing, so if you have time, try it out. Your fellow programmers will respect you more for it.
