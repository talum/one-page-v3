Wow, this was super confusing. 

But I think I successfully changed the color scheme to something more stylish. 

##How I Did It
With lots of help. Specifically, [this post](http://tsiege.github.io/blog/2014/04/27/tips-on-setting-up-octopress/) and [this one from the Octopress folks](http://octopress.org/docs/theme/styles/). Basically, I went into the sass directory, where I uncommented a couple things and played around with them before substituting some cool colors in and seeing what would happen. Apparently, if you use 

`rake preview`

and then navigate your browser to **localhost:4000**, you can see your changes in real time. Cool.

While I'm doing this, I'm also learning how to use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#emphasis), so please forgive any weird formatting.

I'm still having trouble changing the hover color on the h1 title links for each post though, so if anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it.  

Well, that's it for now. I think I've pretty much done all I wanted to do today. I'm also not doing too well on separating my git commits, so sorry. Work in progress.
