My team had mixed reviews of _Domain Driven Design_ by Eric Evans when we first tried to read it for our technical book club last year. Back then, we were a growing pool of developers mostly all working on the same monolith. We switched from project to project, quickly shipping a feature then moving on.

Months later, we have grown a lot and our team has split into domain-focused squads. I decided to revisit it and it was really eye-opening, which made me think that last year, our team hadn't faced the problems that domain-driven design seeks to solve. But now, maybe, just maybe, we are.


So, for my own notes and for anyone who wants the tl;dr of domain-driven design, I present **DDD Even Quicker**.
